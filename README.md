Hello everyone! I'm an executive in the autism therapy space, and I'm excited to join the github community. My primary motivation is to leverage technology to improve outcomes for individuals with autism, and I'm looking forward to connecting with others here. Please be kind and understanding as I'm just learning github, and I'm open to help and assistance - any advice is much appreciated. Looking forward to connecting!
